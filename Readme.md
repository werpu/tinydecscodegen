# ts-ng-tinydecorations Code Generator

This is bascially a set of intellij plugins in development
to support the [ts-ng-tinydecorations](https://github.com/werpu/ts-ng-tinydecorations) project.


A temporary binary build can be found under

[codegen_plugin/codegen_plugin.zip](https://github.com/werpu/tinydecscodegen/blob/master/codegen_plugin/codegen_plugin.zip)

To install it simply install it via the install plugin from local filesystem
functionality of your Jetbrains ide.


## What can the plugin do

* Generate Typescript classes from Java Dto Files
* Update existing generated typescript classes via the Intellij diff editor after
a successful code generation
* Generate Rest Clients from Spring Rest Endpoints
* New ... Wizards for most of the Angular Artifacts supported by the Tiny Decorations project
* Auto updating of associated mdules if a new artifact is generated


## Is this plugin usable already

Yes definitely, I use both projects in a bigger project, so I am eating my own 
dogfood here. However the ui is bound to change, since it is very basic atm.
Hence there is no offical drop of the plugin into the Jetbrains repo.

More info on how to use it fill follow soon, depending on my time
