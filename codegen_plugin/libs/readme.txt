due to licensing reasons a set
of non openapi libraries cannot be included
in the build

you can find them in your intellij bundle:

under plugins/css/lib

css.jar
css-openapi.jar
css_respurces_en.jar

and under

plugins/JavascriptLanguage/lib
javascript-openapi.jar
JavaScriptLanguage.jar
js-test-common.jar
resources_en.jar

For the full built to work you need to dump
those jars in here
